# Ecommerce
Work in progress build of an ecommerce store

This project is intended to be a standalone ecommerce store. It is designed to allow for more a more customized, development based approach than the common drag and drop site builder platforms such as shopify, square, etc.
I used a prebuilt front end html template for the initial structure and page layout (to save time and im not a designer :) ), converted it to jade/pug for server side rendering, and then began modifying it for my use. 
The solution provided does not include a database or the schema, but should be relatively readable. It is a work in progress, I have not necessarily organized the routes in the best way and comments are lacking in some places.
This is also my first build experimenting with the greenlock free ssl integration.
